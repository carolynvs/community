# SIG Service Catalog Charter
Service Catalog is a Kubernetes extension project that implements the [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) (OSBAPI).
It allows application developers the ability to provision and consume cloud services natively from within Kubernetes.

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/README.md).

## Scope

### In scope

This SIG’s main goals are:
- Support, and adhere to, the Platform requirements of the OSBAPI specification.
- Provide a UX for Kubernetes users that is consistent with both the OSB API specification and traditional Kubernetes user interactions.
- Align with the [OSBAPI specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md) as changes are made.
- Provide feedback (bugs or feature requests) to the OSBAPI WG.

### Out of scope

The following, non-exhaustive, items are out of scope:
- Operation of OSBAPI Service Brokers.

## Roles

- Maintainers
  - Responsible for approving, and reviewing, pull requests.
  - Responsible for technical planning and stewardship of the project.
  - New maintainers are nominated by a chair and require unanimous consent by all chairs.
  - Maintainers can be “retired” at the suggestion of a chair, and approved unanimously by the other chairs.

- Chairs
  - All maintainer’s roles.
  - Responsible for project administration activities within the SIG and are non-technical
    in nature, such as organizing the weekly meetings.
  - A chair does not have more rights, or votes, than a maintainer.
  - Responsible for reporting the SIG’s status to the appropriate Kubernetes leadership teams.
  - Chairs MAY decide to step down at anytime and MAY propose a replacement, ideally from existing
    maintainers. Use lazy consensus amongst chairs with fallback on majority vote to accept proposal.
  - Chairs MAY select additional chairs through a super-majority vote amongst chairs.
  - Chairs MUST remain active in the role and MAY removed from the position
    if they are unresponsive for > 3 months or are not proactively working
    with other chairs to fulfill responsibilities. Use lazy consensus amongst chairs with
    fallback on majority vote.

- Emeritus Chairs ([Inspired by the Helm Project](http://technosophos.com/2018/01/11/introducing-helm-emeritus-core-maintainers.html))
  - A chair who steps down may be given the title of Emeritus Chair. This title confers
    honor on the recipient and allows them to remain associated with the SIG in acknowledgement
    of their significant contributions.
  - Those who attain this title are no longer expected to attend the weekly meetings,
    share in the issue queue triage rotation, vote on policy or architectural issues, or review pull requests.
  - They are listed in our documentation as Emeritus Chairs, and we will continue to invite
    them to participate in related events, such as KubeCon.

- Security Contacts
  - Are a contact point for the Product Security Team to reach out to for triaging and handling of incoming issues.
  - Must be a maintainer.
  - Must accept the Kubernetes [Embargo Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/security-release-process-documentation/security-release-process.md#embargo-policy).
  - Defined in [SECURITY_CONTACTS](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/SECURITY_CONTACTS) file.

## Organizational management

- SIG meets every week on Zoom at 1 PM PST on Mondays
    - Agenda [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xlpkoEbPR5M6P5VDzNx17q6-IPFxKyebEekCGYiIKM/edit#).
    - Anyone is free to add new agenda items to the doc.
    - Recordings of the calls are made available [here](https://goo.gl/ZmLNX9).
- SIG members explicitly representing the group at conferences (SIG progress reports, deep dives, etc.)
  should make their slides available for perusal and feedback at least 2 week in advance.
- [Working groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fghxARW-doHrNmBYCijhODsGoIFawpeU4X0end-XnUI/edit#) can be initiated by any member. To create a new one, add the topic
  to the weekly call’s agenda for discussion.
  - These are not the same as cross-SIG working groups.
  - Working groups exist for an unspecified period of time, so that interested members
    can meet to discuss and solve problems for our SIG.

### Project management
- Milestones are defined by SIG maintainers.
- Anyone is free to request for a discussion of the milestones/plans during
  a weekly call.
- Weekly releases are typically done on Thursdays, and any member who has
  maintainer rights is free to initiate it. _Friday releases are strongly discouraged._
- Major releases are planned and discussed among the SIG members during
  regular weekly calls.
- The release process is defined [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/wiki/Release-Process).
- Anyone can request to work on an issue by commenting on it with `#dibs`.


### Technical processes
- All technical decisions are made either through issues, pull requests or
  discussions during the weekly SIG meeting. Major decisions should be documented
  in an issue or pull request.
- There is no requirement that all pull requests have an associated issue.
  However, if the PR represents a significant design decision then it is
  recommended that it be discussed among the group to avoid unnecessary
  coding that might not be accepted.
- While everyone is encouraged to contribute to the discussion of
  any topic, ultimately any changes made to the codebase must be
  approved by the maintainers.
- Pull requests are required to have at least 2 maintainers approve them using the `LGTM 1` and `LGTM 2` labels.
- Pull requests that are labeled with `do not merge` or have an on-going
  discussion must not be merged until all concerns are addressed.
- Disagreements are mainly resolved via consensus. In the event that a common
  decision cannot be made, then a vote among the maintainers will be taken.
  Simple majority (>50%) wins.
